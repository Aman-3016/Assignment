Git is a distributed version control system  for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.
 Git plays a vital role when it comes to managing the code that the collaborators contribute to the shared repository. This code is then extracted for performing continuous integration to create a build and test it on the test server and eventually deploy it on the production.
The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. A git repository contains, among other things, the following: A set of commit object
basically it has 2 repository one is local and another is remote.And developers can work offline on local repository and when he has done all of the changes he can commit it to the remote repository
