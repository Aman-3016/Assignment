Git is a distributed version control system  for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple
people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of
files.
Git plays a vital role when it comes to managing the code that the collaborators contribute to the shared repository. This code is then 
extracted for performing continuous integration to create a build and test it on the test server and eventually deploy it on the 
production.
The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure 
called a repository. A git repository contains, among other things, the following: A set of commit object
basically it has 2 repository one is local and another is remote.And developers can work offline on local repository and when he has done 
all of the changes he can commit it to the remote repository
