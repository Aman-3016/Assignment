What is sed?
SED stands for stream editor and it can perform lotâ€™s of function on file like, searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. Though most common use of it is for substitution or for find and replace. By using SED you can edit files even without opening it, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.
It support regular expression which allows it perform complex pattern matching.

Syntax

sed OPTIONS  [SCRIPTS] <name of the file>

sed 's/begin/end' file1.txt 

In above command, we are searching for unix first occurence in a line  and replacing it by linux in file1.txt

so basically 
/pattern_be_operated/pattern_to_be_inserted
for ex- /begin/end/

And we can use different option like -

sed 's/begin/end/g' file1.txt     ///replacing the begin word with end in file1.txt
sed 's/before/after/2 file2.txt   /// replacing the first and second occurence of the word before with after in every line of  file 2

to delete 

sed '2d' file2.txt            ///will delete the second line in file2.txt
sed '2,10d' file3.txt          ///will delete the lines from 2 to 10th line of file3.txt
sed '/pattern/d' file3.txt    /// will delete the line which match this pattern

to print

sed 's/expert/beginner/p' file1.txt     //print replaced line twice and line which are not replaced are printed once 
sed -n 's/expert/beginner/p' file1.txt  //print replaced line only

regexp

sed 's/^.*at/(&)/' file1.txt      // & represent the matched pattern so it will put the matched pattern in parenthesis
sed 's/\([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\) \([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*\)/\2 \1/' file2.txt  // and \1 and \2 represent first and second parenthesis it will replace firsttwo words of each lines
